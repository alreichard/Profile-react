           <p>My name is Alex Reichard, and I am from West Chester, Pennsylvania. I am a rising sophomore at Haverford
                college, where I study mathematics with a economics minor. I am learning about computer languages to
                allow for more options in a future career. So far this class has been great and I have learned a lot. I
                am excited to see what the next three months entails!</p>
